You might be like me and have a one or two personal projects that you haven't touched for a while. <Notation type="highlight" color="yellow">When you finally get back to them, you realize that there are a lot of dependencies that needs to be updated.</Notation> It can be a tedious task to go through all of them and check if there are any new versions available. You might also find yourself in a situation where the dependencies are so out-dated, that it would be easier to start everything from scratch, rather than migrating to new versions.

<Notation type="bracket"><Notation type="highlight" color="red">TLDR;</Notation> Using
    [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) automated pull requests for version upgrades,
    [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for E2E and [visual regression
    testing](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to
    automatically approve and merge the pull requests, you can almost completely automate the process of keeping your
    project dependencies up to date. </Notation>

The following guide is based on a Next.js project, but <Notation type="highlight" color="yellow">the same principles can be applied to other projects based on different programming languages and frameworks.</Notation>
- Playwright for example [supports Node.js, Python, Java and .NET](https://playwright.dev/docs/languages).
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) could be [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) with equivalent features.
- [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) is available for GitHub, but there are other tools like [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) that can be used as well.

## Let's get started

### 1. Adding Dependabot to your repository

<Notation type="highlight" color="yellow">This is done easily by adding a `dependabot.yml` file inside the `.github`
    folder in your repository.</Notation> Here is an example of how the file could look like:

```yml
# .github/dependabot.yml

version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
      time: "08:00"
      timezone: "Europe/Helsinki"
```

To quickly go through the main parts of the file:
- `package-ecosystem` specifies the package manager that Dependabot should look for updates for. In this case, it's npm.
- `open-pull-requests-limit` specifies the maximum number of open pull requests that Dependabot can have at the same time.
- `directory` specifies the directory where Dependabot should look for updates. In this case, it's the root directory.
- `schedule` specifies how often Dependabot should check for updates. In this case, it's daily at 8:00 AM in the Europe/Helsinki timezone.

### 2. Adding Playwright tests part of your CI pipeline

<Notation type="highlight" color="yellow">To make sure that the updates don't break your
    application</Notation>, you can add Playwright tests to your CI pipeline.

<br/>

<strong>1. Install playwright</strong>

You should follow the [official installation guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) to install Playwright.

<strong>2. Create a test file</strong>

```typescript
// tests/example.spec.ts
import {test, expect} from '@playwright/test';

const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';

test('verify title', async ({page}) => {
    await page.goto(BASE_URL);
    await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Page title/);
});
```

In the test we are simply visiting the local development server and checking that the title of the page matches the regex `/Page title/`.


<strong>3. Adding visual regression tests</strong>

You can add visual regression tests to your Playwright tests by using the `toHaveScreenshot` matcher. Here is an example of how you could add a visual regression test to the previous test file:

```typescript
test("regression test", async ({page}) => {
    await page.goto(BASE_URL)
    await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('frontpage.png', {fullPage: true});
})
```

You can read more about the visual regression testing with screenshots from the official documentation [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots).


<strong>4. Running the tests with GitHub Actions</strong>

You can create a [GitHub Actions workflow file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) that runs the tests on every pull request. Here is an example of how the file could look like:

```yml
# .github/workflows/playwright.yml

name: Playwright tests

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  playwright-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm i
      - name: Install Playwright Browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - name: Build app
        run: npm run build
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        id: run-tests
        run: npm run test
```

### 3. Automatically approve and merge Dependabot pull requests

<Notation type="highlight" color="yellow">To automatically approve and merge the Dependabot pull requests</Notation>,
you can create a [GitHub Actions workflow file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) that listens for new pull requests from Dependabot and automatically approves and merges them.

Here is an example of how the file could look like:

```yml
# .github/workflows/dependabot.yml

name: Dependabot auto-approve
on: pull_request

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  dependabot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.actor == 'dependabot[bot]'
    steps:
      - name: Dependabot metadata
        id: metadata
        uses: dependabot/fetch-metadata@v2
        with:
          github-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
      - name: Approve a PR
        run: gh pr review --approve "$PR_URL"
        env:
          PR_URL: ${{github.event.pull_request.html_url}}
          GH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
      - name: Enable auto-merge for Dependabot PRs
        run: gh pr merge --auto --merge "$PR_URL"
        env:
          PR_URL: ${{github.event.pull_request.html_url}}
          GH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

## What do we have so far?

<Notation type="bracket">
Here's a quick recap what we have done so far:
    - <Notation type="underline">Added Dependabot to your repository to automatically create pull requests for version upgrades.</Notation>
    - <Notation type="underline">Added Playwright tests to your CI pipeline to make sure that the updates don't break your application.</Notation>
    - <Notation type="underline">Created a GitHub Actions workflow file that listens for new pull requests from Dependabot and automatically approves and merges them.</Notation>
</Notation>

There are still a few caveats to this setup that you should be aware of:
- The Dependabot workflow for approving and merging <Notation type="highlight" color="red">does not take into account whether the tests passed or not.</Notation>
- If you are on GitHub Free plan and are planning to keep the repository private, <Notation type="highlight" color="red">you are not able to use [branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) to require certain checks to pass before merging.</Notation>

I was able to find <Notation type="highlight" color="yellow">a workaround</Notation> for the above mentioned by creating a single workflow file, that listens for both the Dependabot and Playwright events. The workflow file then runs the Playwright tests and <i>only</i> approves and merges the Dependabot pull request if the tests pass.

It's <Notation type="highlight" color="yellow">not dependant on branch protection rules nor any 3rd party actions.</Notation> It will still work even <Notation type="highlight" color="yellow">if I decide to keep the repository private.</Notation>

Here's an example of a final workflow file that was able to achieve this for me personally and have been running successfully for a while now:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/henrihuuskonen/c4769655e576234758fe7d9fd0dc4b5e.js"></script>

If you managed to get this far, I hope you found this guide helpful and that you were able to automate the process of keeping your project dependencies up to date.
